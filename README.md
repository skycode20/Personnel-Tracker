  ## Description    

  The Personnel Tracker is a CLI application that allows the user to easily manage their employee database for their organization. The application is seamless and walks the user through each step of the process of viewing employees, adding/removing employees, adding/removing roles, and more. This is important for an organization that wants to be well aware of how many employees there are, who their employees are, and how much is being spent on salaries. As a result, the user can easily access and update the information that is necessary for him/her to efficiently manage the resources of the business.

  My inspiration behind this project was to provide an application that essentially does the thinking for the user. I believe that entering information into databases should be simple and intuitive. Especially for the user that doesn't have the luxury of time to learning new systems.

  One of the challenges I faced in this project was finding a way to add a new employee. When I completed that I wanted to find a way to program the addEmployee function to also add the department name to their entry while adding them into the database. Unfortunately I was running into a foreign key error that didn't enable me to complete that task. 

  In the future I would like to make this a standalone application that operates outside of the CLI. I can envision it working on mobile phones and tablets so that it could allow data entry from anywhere.
